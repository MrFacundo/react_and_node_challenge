# Electro Challenge

This repository contains two main applications:

1. **Backend (Hapi Server)**
   - A server-side application built with Hapi.js.
   - It uses SQLite as the database and Knex.js for query building and migrations.
   - To set up the backend, navigate to the `hapi-server` directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md`.

2. **Frontend (React App)**
   - A client-side application built with React and Vite.
   - It provides a user interface for interacting with the backend.
   - To set up the frontend, navigate to the `react-app` directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md`.

Both applications are designed to work together to provide a full-stack solution.
